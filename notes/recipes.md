## Referencing Vanilla Recipes
1. Go to `External Libraries` and find `net.minecraft:client:extra:<minecraft version>`
2. Expand it and find `data.minecraft.recipes`. This directory has all the recipes in the game and their templates.
* This is the easiest way to make new recipes.

The name of the file does not matter, although it's best practice to name it something relevant.
